Wyatt's change log from V4R2 to V5.1B

1. Map! - The base and two farps were remodelled into more organized layouts.  Spawn is no longer so crammed when starting a new, full game.  New lighting, for that sexy time glow.
2. Designed and installed base safety script.  All players and vehicles are unable to fire at base, AI excluded.   This script is only used for respawning vehicles, players and first spawn vehicles have it in their init line.  JIP ready.
3. Updated vehicle respawn script from 1.6 to 1.7; Modified script to handle base safety on vehicle respawn.
4. Redid the ammo/weapon boxes.  HQ and FARPS has every bluefor gun and ammunition possible.  Ammo supply boxes now carry semi-random amounts of ammo for all weapons.
5. Tweaked the intro view some.   Removed the force NVG.
6. Worked on the HALO/paradrop scripts.   A good base line is there if we bring it back.  Currently you can skydive, deploy parashoot the steer it!   Could add it as an exit option on helicopters/C130/MV22?
7. Helicopter service points - You no longer need to hit a bullseye every time.  Radius doubled at FARPS and the service point at base is now big enough to land 3 MV22s in it.  No more repair-blocking!
8. Jet service points - Service points are much larger and easier to hit.
9. New vehicles - Lots of bicycles added.  An extra m1a1 and TUSK were added. An extra C-130J and MV-22 were added.
10. Went bughunting!  Fixed ~5 script errors that were pre-existing.
11. I realized that Anzu's anti-satchel script was redundant now.  Deleted.
12. Added delays to some while loops to decrease lag.  Alpha testers reported a massive performance increase after only 2 scripts were modified.  I don't remember witch.

1. Added custom textures for the A-10 thunderbolt.
2. Fixed the airlifting ability of the MH-60S. and MV-22.
3. Added respawning for the admin vehicles (seriously don't abuse this).
4. Admin C-130J (AC-130) now supports HALO jumping.
5. Removed the hints that were created whenever flares were fired. (They still don't actually do anything yet, they're just cosmetic).
6. F-35s have been equipped with 2 AGM-65 Mavericks each (Because they were pretty useless with only GBUs, no one flew them at all).
7. Admin variants of the MH-60S and UH-1Y have been added to the admin base, they are not equipped with flares due to issues with their door gunners.
8. Updated the "Vehicle Rank Unlocks" note to reflect changes to the ranks (And to fix the formatting).
9. Updated the points required to advance through the ranks (to have them look nicer for the rank unlocks note)
	- Corporal - Moved down from 17 points to 15 points.
	- Sergeant - Moved up from 33 points to 35 points.
	- Lieutenant - Moved down from 66 points to 65 points.

5. Insurgents have now started supporting the russians by providing ZSU-23 Shilkas to the battlefield. (I know they're worse than tunguskas, but it should help with a little bit of variety).
6. Enemy AI will no longer drive mobile artillery into the heat of battle (Because seriously it's a stupid idea to try and direct fire MLRS and GRAD rockets at things).
